# Product Usage Log Process Mining- A Research Agenda for Data Driven Product Design and Evaluation


## Process Mining Overview

[**Process mining**][process-mining] is an emerging discipline and set of
techniques for exploring and analyzing event logs. In a nutshell, process 
mining uses event logs to create models of those events in the context of
a specific process or use. Applications have included analyzing event logs
from CRM systems or other information systems which contain events that 
can be used to build a model of a multi-event process. These models can be
used for exploratory data analysis or to compare actual event data to a
ideal model for a process. Please see Wil M. P. van der Aalst's book, 
[**Process Mining**][book] (2011) for more details.

## Research Project Overview

Our project seeks to add to the work done in process mining by focusing on 
process mining as a means to better understand the use of digital products 
like Software as a Service (SaaS). Specifically, we are interested in 
using process mining as a tool and methodology to understand the value 
co-creation processes between SaaS providers and their users. To this end,
there are several unique elements and contributions we hope to make to both
practice and academic research in this area. 


  -Our technical approach is based on current Big Data technologies which
  allow for parallel and distributed processing in the cloud rather than
  the current process mining tools that are desktop applications. We hope 
  our work will enable process mining techniques to be employed with 
  "web scale" datasets.

  -Our research dataset was generated by a SaaS using the JSON Activity
  Streams [**specification**][streams] which is an increasingly common format for
  SaaS user event logging. We hope to provide insight into how such general
  formats can easily be used as inputs into a process mining analysis workflow.

  -We plan to build our analysis pipeline and tools using the Python programming
  language. [**Python**][python] and its [**SciPy**][scipy] ecosystem of mathematics,
  science, and engineering libraries are increasingly being used in both
  practice and research when doing data mining and analysis on large and diverse 
  datasets.

  -We plan to contribute any libraries, frameworks, or approaches we develop
  to the open source community under a BSD license. 

  -Our research dataset includes 10's of millions of events generated by
  10's of thousands of users nested in multiple organizations. The dataset 
  includes both user and system generated events. We hope that the challenges 
  of this dataset will enable us to better address user logs form SaaS products 
  that have millions of users and exponentially increasing numbers of events.

  -Our dataset spans 2.5 years during which time several major product enhancements 
  were deployed. We hope this long span of time and large number of end users will 
  allow us to explore issues of value co-creation processes between users and a SaaS 
  offering.
